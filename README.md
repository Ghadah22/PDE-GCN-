## PDE-GCN+: An Explainable Data-Engineering Framework for Multivariate Spatiotemporal Forecasting














##  Acknowledgment

We appreciate the following work for their valuable code and data for time-series forecasting:

- **[DFGCN](https://github.com/junjieyePhD/DFGCN/tree/main)** — Dynamic Fusion Graph Convolutional Network
- **[iTransformer](https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer)** - ITRANSFORMER: INVERTED TRANSFORMERS ARE
EFFECTIVE FOR TIME SERIES FORECASTING
